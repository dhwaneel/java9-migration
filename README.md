# Java 9 migration demo

This repository is practical demonstration of a java 8 application migration to java 9. The application used in this demonstration is an implementation of the CQRS pattern taken from [java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns).

There are four branchs in this repository:

* [master](https://github.com/isabiq/java9-migration/tree/master) : cqrs application as extracted from java-design-patterns running under java 8.
* [java9-classpath](//github.com/isabiq/java9-migration/tree/java9-classpath) : cqrs running under java 9 in the classpath (the unamed module).
* [java9-module-v1](//github.com/isabiq/java9-migration/tree/java9-module-v1) : cqrs and its direct dependencies running as modules.
* [java9-module-v2](//github.com/isabiq/java9-migration/tree/java9-module-v2) : cqrs and its dependencies running as modules.

In each branch you'll find at least three scripts in the bin directory. Each script compiles and runs the application using a different way. One using the command line, the other using maven and the third as a docker image. You'll find also in the java 9 branchs a script which uses jlink to generate a dependency report and the module-info in the temp/ directory.

Detailed steps can be found at : [A Practical Guide to Java 9 Migration](https://dzone.com/articles/a-practical-guide-to-java-9-migration)

### Environment

* Linux
* java "9.0.1"
* java "1.8.0_151"
* maven 3.5.2
* docker 17.09.1-ce (optional: if you want to run CQRS as docker container)


Notice that for the master branch you'll need to configure JAVA_HOME for java 8. For the other branchs you'll need to switch to java 9.
